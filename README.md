# Linux
### What is Linux?
* Linus Torvalds developed Linux, a Unix-like, free, open-source, and kernel operating system. Mainly it is designed for systems, servers, embedded devices, mobile devices, and mainframes and is also supported on major computer platforms such as ARM, x86, and SPARC.

### Explain the basic features of the Linux OS.
Some basic features of Linux are:

* Linux is free and easily available.
* It is more secure than other operating systems because it uses security auditing and password authentication features.
* Linux has its personal software repository.
* It includes multiple languages throughout the world. Hence Linux supports different language keyboards.
* It offers CLI and GUI to use different commands and applications such as Firefox, VLC, etc.

### Name some Linux Distros
There are various Linux distros but the following are the most commonly used:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* CentOS
* Fedora
* RedHat

### What is Linux Kernal
* The Linux kernel is the core of a Linux operating system, acting as a bridge between hardware and software. It manages system resources, handles input/output, and provides a platform for applications to run. Essentially, it's the essential program that allows your computer to function by managing hardware and software interactions. 

### Define the basic components of Linux.
Majorly there are five basic components of Linux:

* Kernel: Linux kernel is a core part of the operating system that works as a bridge between hardware and software.
* Shell: Shell is an interface between a kernel and a user.
* GUI: Offers different way to interact with the system, known as the graphical user interface (GUI).
* Application programs: It is designed to perform a bundle of tasks through a bundle of functions.
* System Utilities: It is the software functions through which users manage the system.

### What is Bootloader in Linux
* In Linux, a bootloader is a program that loads the operating system kernel into memory when the computer starts. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the operating system, initializing the system and allowing the user to select which OS or kernel to boot. Common Linux bootloaders include GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) and LILO (Linux Loader). 

###  What is Shell in Linux?
In Linux, five Shells are used:

* csh (C Shell): This shell offers job control and spell checking and is similar to C syntax.
* ksh (Korn Shell): A high-level shell for programming languages.
* ssh (Z Shell): This shell has a unique nature, such as closing comments, startup files, file name generating, and observing logout/login watching.
* bash (Bourne Again Shell): This is the default shell for Linux.
* Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell): This shell provides auto-suggestion, web-based configuration, etc.


### What is a root account?
* The root is like the user's name or system administrator account in Linux. The root account provides complete system control, which an ordinary user cannot do.

### Describe CLI and GUI in Linux.
* CLI, i.e., command line interface. It takes input as a command and runs the tasks of the system. 
The term GUI refers to the Graphical User Interface or the human-computer interface. It uses icons, images, menus, and windows, which can be manipulated through the mouse.


# Linux Commands
    This page contains linux shell commands and its details 

## git commands to push the changes from local (Laptop) to the remote repository (https://github.com/)
    *   Go to the local repository folder in the laptop.
    *   Open terminal from that folder and type wsl
    *   To open vscode use the below command (in smaller case)
    *   code .
    *   vscode opens here.
    *   Edit the files which you need.
    *   Save the changes in the file.
    *   git add .   --> This will add all files from current folder to staging area in the local repository
    *   git commit -m "our message here" --> Push the changes from staging area to local git repository
    *   git push    --> Genrealy we use (git push origin main), where origin is the remote reposiotry and main is local repository. During git config we already set this up, so simple git push will merger the changes in local to remote
    *   We can see the details of the git workflow in this image

### cd (change directory)
* cd [without arguments]    : This will return you to your home directory. 
* cd [directory_name]       : This will move you into the specified directory. You can use either a relative path (relative to your current directory) or an absolute path (starting from the root directory, /). 
* cd ..                     : This moves you up one level in the directory hierarchy (to the parent directory). 

*Example*

```
/mnt/d/Priyas git$ cd ..
/mnt/d$
```
* cd -                      : This will take you back to the previously visited directory. 

*Example*
```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/mnt/d/Priyas git/data$ cd
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:~$ cd -
/mnt/d/Priyas git/data
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/mnt/d/Priyas git/data$
```

* cd /                      : This will take you to the root directory. 
* cd ~                      : This will take you to your home directory, similar to cd alone. 

### mkdir (make directory)

## Process Management (ps, top, kill, nohup)

## Project Setup â€“ AutoReports (LINUX Course Project)

* You are a developer managing a project named AutoReports on a Linux system.
* You are currently located in your Downloads directory:
  /home/yourusername/Downloads
* This directory contains a mix of files.
### Tasks
* Create a new project folder named AutoReports in your home directory.

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ sudo mkdir AutoReports
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ ls
AutoReports  priya
```
* Inside AutoReports, create the following folder structure using a single command:
    *	src/
    *	src/scripts/
    *	src/modules/
    *	output/
    *	logs/

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ cd AutoReports/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ sudo mkdir -p src/scripts src/modules output logs
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ cd src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src$ ls
modules  scripts
```
* In the Downloads directory, there are three files:
    * report1.txt
    * report2.txt
    * report_final.txt
    * Move only the files that start with report and end with .txt to the AutoReports/output/ directory.

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/mnt/c/Users/LOGAPRIYA$ cd Downloads/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/mnt/c/Users/LOGAPRIYA/Downloads$ touch report1.txt report2.txt report_final.txt
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/mnt/c/Users/LOGAPRIYA/Downloads$ ls

priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ sudo mv /mnt/c/Users/LOGAPRIYA/Downloads/report*.txt ./output/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ cd output
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/output$ ls
report1.txt  report2.txt  report_final.txt
```
* Inside src/scripts, create a blank file named main.sh and make it executable.

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src/scripts$ sudo touch main.sh
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src/scripts$ ls
main.sh
```
* In the logs directory:
    * Create a file named error.log.
    * Then, create a symbolic link to error.log inside the src/ directory.

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ sudo touch ./logs/error.log
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ cd logs
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/logs$ ls
error.log

priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/logs$ cd ..
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ cd src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src$  sudo ln -s ../logs/error.log ./error_link
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src$ ls
error_link  modules  scripts

```
* Remove the entire modules directory only if it exists and is empty.

*Example*

```
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ ls
AutoReports  priya
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ cd AutoReports/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ cd ..
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ sudo rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty AutoReports/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ ls
AutoReports  priya
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ cd AutoReports/
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports$ ls
logs  output  src
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home/AutoReports/src$ cd ../..
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ sudo rm -rf AutoReports
priya@LAPTOP-TSTPS35I:/home$ ls
priya

```
